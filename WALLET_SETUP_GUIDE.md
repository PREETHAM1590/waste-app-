# Wallet Connection Setup Guide

## Fixed Issues

I've fixed several issues with the wallet connection:

### 1. **Configuration Mismatch Fixed**
- ✅ Updated Web3Auth redirect URI to match Android package name
- ✅ Fixed Android manifest deep linking configuration
- ✅ Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. **Fallback Wallet Option Added**
- ✅ Added local wallet creation as fallback when Web3Auth fails
- ✅ Local wallets are stored securely on device using Flutter Secure Storage
- ✅ Both wallet types (Web3Auth and local) work with the same interface

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- ✅ Added detailed error messages and status updates
- ✅ Added initialization status checking
- ✅ Added connection state monitoring

## How to Test

### Option 1: Web3Auth Connection
1. Open the app and navigate to the wallet screen
2. Tap "Connect with Web3Auth (Google)"
3. You should see detailed logs in the console about the connection process
4. If it fails, check the error message for specific issues

### Option 2: Local Wallet (Recommended for Testing)
1. Open the app and navigate to the wallet screen
2. Tap "Create Local Wallet"
3. This should work immediately and create a local Solana wallet
4. Use "Request Airdrop" to get test SOL tokens

## Troubleshooting Web3Auth Issues

If Web3Auth still doesn't work, the issue might be:

1. **Invalid Client ID**: The current Client ID might be invalid or expired
   - You need to create a new project at https://dashboard.web3auth.io
   - Add the redirect URI: `com.example.waste_classifier_flutter://auth`
   - Update the `clientId` in `lib/web3auth_config.dart`

2. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection

3. **Google Services**: Make sure Google Play Services are working on your emulator/device

## What Changed

### Files Modified:
- `lib/main.dart` - Better Web3Auth initialization logging
- `lib/web3auth_config.dart` - Fixed redirect URI to match package name
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Fixed deep linking scheme
- `lib/services/web3auth_solana_service.dart` - Added fallback wallet methods
- `lib/screens/solana_wallet_screen.dart` - Added dual wallet support UI

### Key Features Added:
- Local wallet creation and management
- Unified wallet interface (works with both Web3Auth and local wallets)
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Connection status monitoring
- Automatic wallet detection on app start

## Next Steps

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Check console logs** for Web3Auth initialization messages
3. **Try local wallet first** - it should work immediately
4. **For Web3Auth**, you may need to update the Client ID with a valid one from your Web3Auth dashboard

The local wallet option ensures you can test all wallet functionality even if Web3Auth isn't configured properly.
