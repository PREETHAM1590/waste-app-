# Navigation Test Instructions

## Test the following after running `flutter run`:

1. **Initial Load Test**:
   - App should show loading screen briefly
   - Then show Welcome screen with 3 buttons:
     - Get Started
     - Log In
     - Connect Wallet

2. **Wallet Connection Test**:
   - Tap "Connect Wallet" button
   - Should navigate to Web3Auth login screen
   - Try login with Email or Google
   - After successful login, should navigate to Web3 wallet screen

3. **Session Persistence Test**:
   - After login, hot restart the app (press R in terminal)
   - App should automatically navigate to wallet screen
   - Should NOT show welcome screen again

4. **Logout Test**:
   - From wallet screen, tap logout button
   - Should navigate back to welcome screen
   - Hot restart should show welcome screen (not wallet)

## Fixed Issues:
- ✅ Navigation now uses GoRouter consistently
- ✅ Routes are properly defined and accessible
- ✅ Session persistence checks on app startup
- ✅ Auto-navigation based on login state

## Commands:
```bash
# Run the app
flutter run

# Hot restart (while app is running)
Press 'R' in terminal

# Hot reload (for minor changes)
Press 'r' in terminal
```
